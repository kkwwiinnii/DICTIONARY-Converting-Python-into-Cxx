# DICTIONARY-Converting-Python-into-Cxx
ECEAC1_Lab Activity 6: Recreating the Python dictionary into C++ with the use of an if-else-if statement style.

This Engineering Dictionary was created using Cxxdroid. To make the dictionary, the code employed elements such as the if-else-if statements. It also used cout and cin functions to display specific messages and inputs to get information from the user. With these elements combined, it produced the output, which is the Engineering Dictionary.
